# Component library architecture design  

## 1. Introduction  

This document aims to provide a blueprint for the design of a component library, enabling the logic, style performance, and interfaces of components to be independently developed and maintained, thereby enhancing code reusability, maintainability, and team collaboration efficiency.  

## 2. Architecture Overview  

### 2.1 Design Goals  

- **Modularity**: Components should be independent, facilitating reuse and composition.  
- **Customizability**: Allow developers to customize styles and behaviors according to project needs.  
- **Maintainability**: Through clear interfaces, simplify the process of updating and maintaining components.  

### 2.2 Components Composition  

A component mainly consists of the following three parts:  

- **Logic (Behavior)**: Business logic and state management.  
- **Style Representation (Style)**: The appearance and style of the component.  
- **Interface (API)**: The properties and methods exposed by the component.  

## 3. Component Logic  

### 3.1 Logic Design Principles  

- Decoupling: Component logic and styles should be independent to ensure logic can be reused in different contexts.  
- State Management: Use lightweight state management tools (e.g., React Context or Redux) to handle component state.  

### 3.2 Implementation  

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component should be responsible for a specific function to avoid complexity.  
- **State Lifting**: If state needs to be shared, use parent components to lift state management.  

## 4. Style Representation  

### 4.1 Style Design Principles  

- **Consistency**: Styles should adhere to a unified design specification to maintain visual consistency.  
- **Reusability**: Styles are organized based on classes and variables for ease of reuse and modification.  

### 4.2 Implementation  

- **CSS Modules or Styled Components**: Write independent style files for each component to avoid global style conflicts.  
- **Theme Management**: Support theme switching, with the ability to dynamically modify styles using CSS variables or stylesheets.  

## 5. Component Interface  

### 5.1 Interface Design Principles  

- **Simplicity**: The component's API should be intuitive and easy to understand.  
- **Flexibility**: Support default values, callback functions, and event handling.  

### 5.2 Property and Method Definition  

- **Input Properties**: Used to receive data and configurations passed from parent components. Example:  
  ```javascript  
  interface ButtonProps {  
      label: string;             // Button text  
      onClick: () => void;      // Click event callback  
      disabled?: boolean;       // Whether the button is disabled  
  }
